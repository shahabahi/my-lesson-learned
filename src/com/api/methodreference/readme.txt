Method Reference :
EG : MethodReferenceDemo and FunctionalInterfaceDemo

Method reference is replacement of lambda expressions. It is used to refer method of Functional interface to an existing method. Mainly it is used for code reusability.

Functional Interfaceâ€™s Abstract method can be mapped to specific existing method using double colon operator (::) . This is Method reference.

Hence Method reference is an alternative to Lambda expressions.

Whenever we have existing Implementation of Abstract method of our Functional interface then we can go for method reference. If no such method like testImplementation() is available then go for lambda expressions.
